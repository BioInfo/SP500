Licensing Model: 
For an open-source project like this, I would recommend using a Creative Commons license, specifically the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license. This license allows others to share, copy, distribute, and adapt your work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they give appropriate credit and license their new creations under identical terms.
Table of Contents:
As you mentioned, the table of contents will be built as chapters are written. Here's a suggested structure:

Chapter Structure:
For each chapter, I suggest the following structure:


Company Overview
Current Challenges and Opportunities
AGI Integration Scenarios
Potential Impact on Industry and Society
Ethical Considerations
Conclusion


Writing Process:
To maintain consistency across chapters while allowing for creativity, consider creating a template or guide for contributors. This could include:


Word count guidelines
Key points to address
Style guide (e.g., use of dialogue, technical depth)
References and citation format


GitHub Integration:
Using GitHub for version control and collaboration is an excellent choice. Consider setting up a repository with:


A clear README file explaining the project and how to contribute
Issue templates for suggesting new ideas or reporting problems
A CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
Separate folders for each sector to organize chapters


Narrative Continuity:
To create a common narrative thread, you could:


Introduce recurring characters (e.g., a journalist investigating the AGI revolution)
Reference global events or AGI milestones across chapters
Explore interconnected impacts (e.g., how changes in one industry affect others)
